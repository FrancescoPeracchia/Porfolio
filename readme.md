      ### Supervised approach
  This Panoptic Segmentation Forecaster is based on this PS model, you should be able to use in your "env" all the fuctionalities required by EfficientPS
  An EfficientPS_env is builded following the requirement described in [EfficientPS](https://github.com/DeepSceneSeg/EfficientPS).
